# Validation resources and worked examples

This directory contains materials to support the validation and testing of datasets formatted according to the Wastewater Contextual Data Specification.

## Contents
- **Worked Example Scenarios**: These provide sample datasets and "answer keys" for common use cases. Users can compare their datasets against these examples to ensure proper formatting and validation.
- **Validation Guidance**: Documentation and tools to help check data consistency, including explanations of validation rules.
- **Subgrant Call Information**: Details about the subgrant testing and collaborative efforts related to this project.

## How to use these resources
To get familiar with the wastewater DataHarmonizer templates, we recommend initially reviewing the worked example scenario's. The answer keys (please note there are different answer keys for the different templates) can be opened directly in the DataHarmonizer, and demonstrate how different scenario's can be structured.

## PHA4GE Wastewater subgrant testing call out

The PHA4GE Wastewater Contextual Data Specification Package provides structured terminology and templates for collecting wastewater data related to SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, AMR detection, and pathogen identification. It includes guidance, examples, and utilizes a validation tool called DataHarmonizer. Developed collaboratively with public health and wastewater experts, it supports data collection, harmonization, and sharing. Users have discretion over its usage and sharing, following organization-specific policies. 

The testing phase aims to ensure utility, applicability, and ease-of-use through community-based assessments, fostering dialogue and improvement. Feedback is encouraged, with users taking part in the PHA4GE sub-grants requested to complete the [feedback form]() with guidance provided in this document. If you are not a part of the sub-grants but are still interested to test the specification, please contact Emma Griffiths emma_griffiths@sfu.ca. Additional training is available upon request. For enquiries, contact datastructures@pha4ge.org.

To complete training you will need the following documents and tools:
