# Wastewater Data Collection Template

Welcome to the Wastewater Data Collection Template repository! This specification is designed to be used with the DataHarmonizer application. To use one of the wastewater templates, please go to the most recent [pathogen genomics package](https://github.com/cidgoh/pathogen-genomics-package/releases/tag/PGPv5.0.1)

The template directory contains .tsv files for reference purposes of the use case wastewater specifications only. Please refrain from using these files as templates, as the DataHarmoniser templates will be made available shortly. Instead, they serve as references for current field and picklist values.


## Files

Within this repository, you'll find subfolders for each use case, with a single tsv for the fields (suffix -slots) and a second tsv for the picklist values (suffix -enums):

- **SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance**: Contains files specific to SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance.
    - WWSC2-slots: Fields representing template slots for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.
    - WWSC2-enums: Values describing picklist options for WWSC2 slots.

- **AMR Wastewater Surveillance**: Includes files related to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) wastewater surveillance.
    - WWAMR-slots: Fields representing template slots for AMR surveillance.
    - WWAMR-enums: Values describing picklist options for WWAMR slots.

- **Single Pathogen Wastewater Surveillance**: Consists of files dedicated to single-pathogen wastewater surveillance.
    - WWSinglePathogen-slots: Fields representing template slots for single-pathogen surveillance.
    - WWSinglePathogen-enums: Values describing picklist options for WWSinglePathogen slots.

## Template Contents

Please note that the .tsv files here are intended for informational and structural guidance only. This repository will be updated the DataHarmonizer for each use case in the near future.
